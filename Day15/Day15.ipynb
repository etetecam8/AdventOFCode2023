    "The HASH algorithm is a way to turn any [string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)) of characters into a single number in the range 0 to 255. To run the HASH algorithm on a string, start with a current value of `0`. Then, for each character in the string starting from the beginning:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Determine the [ASCII code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters) for the current character of the string.\n",
    "-   Increase the current value by the ASCII code you just determined.\n",
    "-   Set the current value to itself multiplied by `17`.\n",
    "-   Set the current value to the [remainder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo) of dividing itself by `256`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After following these steps for each character in the string in order, the current value is the output of the HASH algorithm.\n",

    "-   The current value is multiplied by `17` to become `1224`.\n",

    "-   `qp=3` becomes `97`.\n",
