    "You note down the patterns of ash (`.`) and rocks (`#`) that you see as you walk (your puzzle input); perhaps by carefully analyzing these patterns, you can figure out where the mirrors are!\n",

    "```\n",
    "#.##..##.\n",

    "To find the reflection in each pattern, you need to find a perfect reflection across either a horizontal line between two rows or across a vertical line between two columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first pattern, the reflection is across a vertical line between two columns; arrows on each of the two columns point at the line between the columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "    ><\n",
    "123456789\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this pattern, the line of reflection is the vertical line between columns 5 and 6. Because the vertical line is not perfectly in the middle of the pattern, part of the pattern (column 1) has nowhere to reflect onto and can be ignored; every other column has a reflected column within the pattern and must match exactly: column 2 matches column 9, column 3 matches 8, 4 matches 7, and 5 matches 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second pattern reflects across a horizontal line instead:\n",

    "\n",
    "To summarize your pattern notes, add up the number of columns to the left of each vertical line of reflection; to that, also add 100 multiplied by the number of rows above each horizontal line of reflection. In the above example, the first pattern's vertical line has `5` columns to its left and the second pattern's horizontal line has `4` rows above it, a total of `405`.\n",
