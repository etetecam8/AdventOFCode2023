    "You play several games and record the information from each game (your puzzle input). Each game is listed with its ID number (like the `11` in `Game 11:` ...) followed by a semicolon-separated list of subsets of cubes that were revealed from the bag (like `3 red`, `5 green`, `4 blue`).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the record of a few games might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Game 1:** `3 blue`, `4 red`; `1 red`, `2 green`, `6 blue`; `2 green`\n",
    "- **Game 2:** `1 blue`, `2 green`; `3 green`, `4 blue`, `1 red`; `1 green`, `1 blue`\n",
    "- **Game 3:** `8 green`, `6 blue`, `20 red`; `5 blue`, `4 red`, `13 green`; `5 green`, `1 red`\n",
    "- **Game 4:** `1 green`, `3 red`, `6 blue`; `3 green`, `6 red`; `3 green`, `15 blue`, `14 red`\n",

    "In game 1, three sets of cubes are revealed from the bag (and then put back again). The first set is `3 blue cubes` and `4 red cubes`; the second set is `1 red cube`, `2 green cubes`, and `6 blue cubes`; the third set is only `2 green cubes`.\n",

    "The Elf would first like to know which games would have been possible if the bag contained only `12 red cubes`, `13 green cubes`, and `14 blue cubes`?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, games 1, 2, and 5 would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with that configuration. However, game 3 would have been impossible because at one point the Elf showed you `20 red cubes` at once; similarly, game 4 would also have been impossible because the Elf showed you `15 blue cubes` at once. If you add up the IDs of the games that would have been possible, you get `8`.\n",
